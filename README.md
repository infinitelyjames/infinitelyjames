### Hi there 👋

I'm a student who mainly programs in a variety of languages in my free time, coding whatever takes my fancy. Like some others, I also share an interest in cyber security and malware analysis.
I don't always use GitHub to track my projects, hence if there are gaps it's probably because I'm working on something else.

#### Languages I know
- Python (adept, used packages such as requests, qt5, flask and many more)
- JS (mediocre, familiar with node framework and express)
- Java (mediocre, not familiar with all inbuilt libraries as this is rarely my language of choice)
- C++ (mediocre, currently improving my knowledge)
- Dart

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=infinitelyjames)](https://github.com/infinitelyjames)

based on data from my public repos (not much is public and on github)
  
#### Techniques I've used
- Asynchronous programming and multi-threading
- Lambdas and wrapper functions
- Event-driven programming


🌱 I’m currently learning Vulkan in C++
