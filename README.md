### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student who mainly programs in a variety of languages in my free time, coding whatever takes my fancy. 
I don't always use GitHub to track my projects, hence if there are gaps it's probably because I'm working on something else.
Most of my repositories are private - sometimes I create a public clone once I've finished them, but the vast majority are 98% finished.

#### Languages I know
- Python (adept, used packages such as requests, qt5, flask and many more)
- JS (mediocre, familiar with node framework and express)
- Java (mediocre, not familiar with all inbuilt libraries as this is rarely my language of choice)
- Dart (know syntax and methods required for flutter)
- C++ (low)


ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on a mobile app in Flutter
