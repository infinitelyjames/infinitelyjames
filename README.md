### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I mainly program in python, and other languages (such as js) when better-suited to the project. I program in my free time, coding whatever takes my fancy. Like some others, I also share an interest in cyber security and malware analysis.
I don't always use GitHub to track my projects, hence if there are gaps it's probably because I'm working on something else.

#### Languages I know
- Python (adept, used packages such as requests, qt5, flask and many more)
- JS (mediocre, familiar with node framework and express)
- Java (mediocre, not familiar with all inbuilt libraries as this is rarely my language of choice)
- C++ (mediocre, currently improving my knowledge)
  
#### Techniques I use
- Asynchronous programming and multi-threading
- Lambdas and wrapper functions
